# Nimfuzz

This program was made to "dumb" fuzz the nimbus protocol while I perform reverse engineering. In order to use this tool you'll need to be running python 3.7.3 (or newer). Usage is simple enough just place it in the same directory as the nimbus.exe executable and run it. It can also be ran from Linux, however Windows is preffered so you're not messing with it.

All crashes and timeouts will be placed RAW in logs.txt
